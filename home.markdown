blurb: Spend a night with a real NYC graffiti artist, painting real graffiti.
faq:
- question: Real graffiti?
  answer: That’s right. This is a truly immersive tour, not recommended for the faint
    of heart. If you want a true, hands-on NYC graffiti experience this is the only
    place to get it.
- question: Is this legal?
  answer: Graffiti and street art have always had a complex relationship with the
    law. In order to provide an authentic experience, vandalism laws may have to be
    violated.
- question: What does a tour include?
  answer: Your guide will provide an informative tour of local graffiti landmarks
    and top the night off with a “bombing” session. The exact schedule will vary depending
    on the size of the group and availability of spots to paint.
- question: How to dress?
  answer: Wear a casual outfit that’s easy to move in—we recommend dark clothing,
    . Your guide will supply face coverings if needed.
- question: How much does it cost?
  answer: Tours are $50 per person and last 3 to 4 hours. All paint, caps & gloves
    are provided. Groups range in size from 4 to 8 people. Private tours are available
    upon request.
